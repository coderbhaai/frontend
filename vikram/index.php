                <h2>About the Conclave</h2>
                <p><strong>Global Youth Leadership Conclave 2020</strong> is the first-ever international youth event based on the theme “CRAFTing Leaders for Tomorrow”.</p>
                <p>An initiative taken by TBH Youth Community, “OF the Youth, BY the Youth, FOR the Youth” to CRAFT better future leaders by bridging the gap between ‘youth learning’ and ‘the future leadership’. This is an endeavour to create a borderless collaboration between ‘Leaders of Tomorrow’ and ‘Leaders of Today’. The platform encourages students to network, learn and own their CRAFT: CREATIVITY, RESILIENCE, AGILITY, FOCUS and TRUST in order to meet the challenges of the unpredictable and the dynamic changing business environment.</p>
